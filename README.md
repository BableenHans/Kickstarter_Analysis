# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The fundraiser's goal is to check how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
	
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To analyze data based on launch date chart, fristly a new columb in the source sheet was created- "Years". This column data was converted into years by using the Year() function from the "Date created conversion" column. 
This allowed to create a pivot table from the kickstarted worksheet and compare based on "Parent Category" and "Years"

There were no difficulties enountered while analyzing the chart. At the same time, better results could be output by Sub category to have a more in debt analysis of the Outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Data is analysed using the COUNTIFS function. Firstly, the number of successful, canceled and failed plays are generated in the columns using the COUNTIFS method with data from the Kickstarter worksheet. 
In a separate columm, all the entries based on goal amounts are generated by totalling (SUM())all the successful, failed and canceled plays.
Thereafter, percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays is generated by using the IFERROR function.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - While comparing Theater outcomes with launch dates through the year and over a number of years, the comparison demonstrates that theater is more successful if launches in the summer (specifically in May).
    - It also shows that month in the year has no relation with theater being cancelled as the graph is more or less lateral throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When comparing "plays" categories percentage of successful, percentage of failed plays or percentage of cancelled plays vs the goal funding amount, the graph shows a more complex replationship. 
    - Main outcome that can be concluded is that though one would anticiapte percentage of failed plays to decrease with increase in funding goals, its the opposit. 
    - Secondly, the percentage of plays canceled is irrelevant to the amount of funding goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Though the data is diverse, it lacks information on trends. For edxample, plays being cenceled. Is that due to funding issues or becasue of the trends in the market have changed. Additionally, it doesnt look into the marketing factors of each categories success either.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - Bar graphs to look into each categories and their success 
    - Pie chart to look into see which sub category is more percentage of success within the same parent category
